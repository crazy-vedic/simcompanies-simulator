# Project Rules

- Always keep the `README.md` file up to date with any changes to the program's logic, command-line arguments, or general functionality.
- If you add new dependencies, ensure they are reflected in the `README.md` installation section if applicable.
- If the output format or warning flags change, update the "Output Explanation" section in `README.md`.
